diffdominion found a difference in my friend's dominion with the seed 1.
It is hard to read the diff output, so it's hard to tell who was right.
It's not an ideal case for differential testing because neither of our dominions are known good.

Coverage for my dominion:
File 'dominion.c'
Lines executed:67.96% of 646
dominion.c:creating 'dominion.c.gcov'

Coverage for my friend's dominion:
File './cards.c'
Lines executed:52.94% of 68
./cards.c:creating 'cards.c.gcov'

File 'dominion.c'
Lines executed:71.26% of 581
dominion.c:creating 'dominion.c.gcov'

This averages out to about 60% coverage. This wasn't too hard to get.
It was just necessary to print scores at the end of the game to get enough coverage.
