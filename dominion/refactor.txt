My strategy for extracting the card effect functions generally went along this sequence:

1. Cut the text inside the switch case for the given card
2. In the place of the body of the switch case write something like "return ambassadorEffect();"
3. Up above cardEffect, stub out the function i.e. ambassadorEffect() and paste the body of the switch case inside of it.
4. Based on the build errors, add parameters to the effect function. Pass those parameters at the call site.

One of the weirder aspects of all this is that all the variables in cardEffect are declared at the top-- this means that cutting out the body of a switch case can render the variable unnecessary. I tried to clean these kinds of variable declarations up within reason.
